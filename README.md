## Data Analyst Portfolio

This repository showcases the various data analysis projects I have worked on, demonstrating my proficiency in data cleaning, feature engineering, model building, and data visualization. Each project aims to solve real-world problems by leveraging **machine learning**, **data analysis**, and **visualization** techniques. The goal of these projects is to showcase my skills in **data-driven decision making** and to highlight my ability to derive actionable insights from data.

### Projects Completed

1. **Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster**
   - **Description**: This project aims to predict the survival of passengers aboard the Titanic based on various features such as age, class, and sex.
   - **Skills Demonstrated**: 
     - Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
     - Feature Engineering
     - Logistic Regression Model
     - Model Evaluation and Accuracy Testing

2. **Bitcoin Price Prediction: Forecasting Bitcoin Prices**
- **Description**: This project aims to predict Bitcoinâ€™s closing price using historical minute-level price data. The model employs machine learning techniques, specifically RandomForestRegressor, to forecast future Bitcoin prices based on                       time-series data and key features.
